NAME
    RT::Extension::Zabbix - Merge and resolve Zabbix tickets

DESCRIPTION

    Used to merge and resolve Zabbix tickets automatically.
    Based on https://github.com/bestpractical/rt-extension-nagios, which is in turn 
    based on http://wiki.bestpractical.com/view/AutoCloseOnZabbixRecoveryMessages

INSTALLATION

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install
        make initdb # first time only

	the "make initdb" adds the scrips to the database, so be sure to run it the first
	time or nothing will happen.

    with RT 3.8 or later, you need to update "Plugins" configuration:

        Set( @Plugins, qw(... RT::Extension::Zabbix) );

    below are the extra options:
    (check out lib/RT/Extension/Zabbix.pm if you are confused):

        Set($ZabbixSearchAllQueues, 1);
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, 0); # false, don't merge
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, 1); # merge into the newest ticket.
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, -1); # merge into the oldest ticket.
        Set($ZabbixResolvedStatus, "resolved");

	you may also need to enable full text searching to get the hostname
	from the body of the ticket:

		Set(%FullTextSearch,
	    	Enable => 1,
		   Indexed => 0,
		);
