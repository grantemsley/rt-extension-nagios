NAME
    RT::Extension::Zabbix - Merge and resolve Zabbix tickets

DESCRIPTION

    Used to merge and resolve Zabbix tickets automatically.
    Based on https://github.com/bestpractical/rt-extension-nagios, which is in turn 
    based on http://wiki.bestpractical.com/view/AutoCloseOnZabbixRecoveryMessages

INSTALLATION

        perl Makefile.PL
        make
        make install
        make initdb # first time only

    with RT 3.8 or later, you need to update "Plugins" configuration:

        Set( @Plugins, qw(... RT::Extension::Zabbix) );

    below are the extra options:
    (check out lib/RT/Extension/Zabbix.pm if you are confused):

        Set($ZabbixSearchAllQueues, 1);
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, 0); # false, don't merge
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, 1); # merge into the newest ticket.
        Set($ZabbixMergeTickets, -1); # merge into the oldest ticket.
        Set($ZabbixResolvedStatus, "resolved");
